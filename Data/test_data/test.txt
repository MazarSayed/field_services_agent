Confirmed the Ford Lightning truck was fully charged with a 230-mile range and identified four charging stations in advance to support the delivery.
Drove the truck from the GTII site to Harvest Gold, ensuring safe operation and adherence to range limitations.

Drove back from Harvest Gold while managing battery range, conserving energy by not using the A/C under hot and humid conditions.
Attempted to charge the truck at multiple stations; the first fast-charger was offline and caused the charging cord to lock, requiring remote support, the second charger was offline, and additional Tesla chargers were incompatible, requiring ongoing troubleshooting and support calls.

Contacted Ford Roadside Assistance for towing, coordinated payment after company credit cards were declined, and arranged for the truck to be picked up by the tow service.
Oversaw the truck being towed back to site, unloaded it, and plugged it into the on-site charger to begin full recharge.
