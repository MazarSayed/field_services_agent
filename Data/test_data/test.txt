Spc off line, reconnected mc4 connector tracked spc to charge, spc operational. 
Eric Bowen and Jacob Collins found block 38C SPC324 not tracking and stowed in the west. 
After walking to SPC they found that the SPC light was not flashing, 
after troubleshooting they found that the MC4 from the charging module was not connected properly. 
they then reconnected the MC4 and used the row turner to track row to the east so SPC battery could charge. 
after waiting around 10 minutes for battery to charge they returned SPC to service and it was working properly.

The MC4 connector issue was documented as a potential warranty-related concern. Photos and findings were recorded and submitted to Origis for review, but no parts were replaced during this visit.

Confirmed the Ford Lightning truck was fully charged with a 230-mile range and identified four charging stations in advance to support the delivery.
Drove the truck from the GTII site to Harvest Gold, ensuring safe operation and adherence to range limitations.

Drove back from Harvest Gold while managing battery range, conserving energy by not using the A/C under hot and humid conditions.
Attempted to charge the truck at multiple stations; the first fast-charger was offline and caused the charging cord to lock, requiring remote support, the second charger was offline, and additional Tesla chargers were incompatible, requiring ongoing troubleshooting and support calls.

Contacted Ford Roadside Assistance for towing, coordinated payment after company credit cards were declined, and arranged for the truck to be picked up by the tow service.
Oversaw the truck being towed back to site, unloaded it, and plugged it into the on-site charger to begin full recharge.
