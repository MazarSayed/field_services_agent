The GTII site truck, Ford lightning, (Electric) was at 100% charge with a 230-mile range. The round-trip mileage was roughly 260 miles. Before departing, we located 4 charging stations in Winona, MS on google maps. We departed from GT2 at 10:00 AM and arrived at Harvest gold at 12:40 PM (136 miles from site to site). We then departed from Harvest Gold at 1:30 PM, with a mileage range of 72 miles to empty. We choose not to operate the A/C to save power, with an outside temperature of 89 degrees and with 87% humidity. Upon arrival, at the first Charging Station in Winona MS at 2:30 PM, the Ford lightning had a milage range of 5 miles to empty. The first fast-charging station we went to was offline. We contacted the owner of the charger for support, and they directed us to another charger, since the charger was down and couldn&#39;t be fixed remotely. The charging cord was locked into the truck, and we had to call customer support, for the second time, to get the charging adapter unlocked the remotely. The next charger that we were directed to was offline as well. We tried to find a number for support, but the owner was unavailable to take the call, due to being on vacation in India. The other two charging stations were Tesla chargers and were not compatible with the Ford Lightening. Then, at 4:00 PM, we contacted Ford roadside assistance to be towed back to site. The company credit cards, both site lead and manager’s card declined payment for the tow truck. A personal payment had to be made for the transaction to be approved. The tow truck arrived 2.5 hours later at 6:30 PM. Finally, we arrived back on site and unloaded the truck at 7:30 PM. Once the Ford Lightening was plugged into the charger on site, the estimated charge date to 100% was 10:00 PM on Friday, 6/21/24. </span></p>",,Truck delivery to Harvest gold,Ad Hoc,MS6 - Golden Triangle II (PV/BESS),WO-1052496,MS6 - Golden Triangle II (PV/BESS),,,Completed,,,2024-06-17 13:00:00,2024-06-17 13:00:00
