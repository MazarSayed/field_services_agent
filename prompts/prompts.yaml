validation_instructions: |
  
  VALIDATION APPROACH:
  1. Check if the OPERATIONAL LOG meets the essential REQUIREMENTS. Consider validation PASSED if:
     - The key requirements are covered, either explicitly or implicitly
     - The information is technically complete, even if not perfectly formatted
     - The core details are present across the full context
  
  2. Be flexible in validation by:
     - Not requiring specific terminology or formatting
     - Accepting reasonable implications and context
     - Understanding that details may be spread across the log and Q&A
  
  3. Only mark as invalid when:
     - Critical technical details are missing
     - The work status cannot be properly verified
     - Important safety or compliance items are absent
  
  4. For invalid logs, generate ONE targeted follow-up question that:
     - Focuses specifically on the missing critical information
     - Uses natural, conversational language
     - Avoids repeating previous questions
     - Helps complete the technical requirements



car_format_conversion: |
  Convert the following completion notes into a structured CAR (Cause, Action, Result) format.
  Given below is each work status and notes from the field tech on each task.
  
  Please analyze the notes and provide:
  
  CAUSE: [What caused the need for this work? What was the initial problem or situation?]
  - Identify the root cause or triggering event
  - Include specific component/location/equipment details when available
  - Describe the problem in clear, technical terms
  
  ACTION: [What specific actions were taken? What work was performed?]
  - List the specific tasks completed
  - Include tools, methods, or parts used
  - Mention any diagnostic or testing procedures performed
  - Use past tense and action verbs
  
  RESULT: [What was the outcome? Was the issue resolved? Any recommendations or follow-up needed?]
  - State the current operational status
  - Indicate whether the issue was resolved, partially resolved, or requires further action
  - Include any recommendations for future maintenance or follow-up work
  - Note any remaining issues or limitations
