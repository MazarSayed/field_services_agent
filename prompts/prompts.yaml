validation_instructions: |
  VALIDATION APPROACH :
  1. INTELLIGENTLY EXTRACT information from the technician's responses needed for validation to identify work performed and assess time allocation, expanding terse bullets, shorthand, abbreviations into clear actions
  2. Make sure we meet the requirements in WORK BASED GUIDELINES and WORK ORDER TYPE GUIDELINES based on the technician's responses provided
  3. Detailed steps are not needed, as long as we can understand what was done in the notes, it's valid.
  4. Mark as VALID when the responses provide EVIDENCE after reasonable synthesis of the provided content (including implied steps and expanded abbreviations) supporting the claimed work types and time allocation
  5. Accept implied information, context clues, and indirect descriptions as valid evidence when they are clear and consistent with the conversation and prior logs
  6. Focus on the specific work described in the technician's responses, not generic work types
  7. If the responses describe actions performed and steps taken (even if concise), mark as VALID without asking for more steps
  8. INVALID only if essential information to support a claimed significant work type remain missing after synthesizing the provided content




  
car_format_conversion: |
  Convert the following completion notes into a structured CAR (Cause, Action, Result) format.
  Given below is each work status and notes from the field tech on each task.

  **WORK STATUS TABLE FORMAT**: The work status table is formatted as "Date | Tech Name | Time allocation | Notes | Summary" with each row representing a work log entry. Extract dates from the first column of each row.

  **COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS**: Analyze ALL available information including work status logs, completion notes, and work order description to create comprehensive action items. Extract information from every source to provide thorough documentation of all work performed.

  Please analyze the work status table and provide:

  ### CAUSE: [What caused the need for this work? What was the initial problem or situation?]
  - **PRIMARY SOURCE**: Use the Work Order Description as the main source for the cause
  - Identify the root cause or triggering event from the work order description
  - Include component/location/equipment details when available
  - Describe the problem in clear, technical terms

  ### ACTION: [What specific actions were taken? What work was performed?]
  - **FORMAT**: Use bullet points with date and time: "- Date - Time -> {specific actions performed}"
  - **ONE ACTION PER LOG**: Create exactly one action bullet point for each work log entry in the work status table
  - **WORK TYPE SELECTION**: For each work log, set the Action's work type to the highest percentage work type for that log (the dominant type). Ignore the rest of the work types. If no percentages are available, infer a single dominant type from the described actions
  - List the specific tasks completed with their corresponding dates
  - Include tools, methods, or parts used
  - Mention any diagnostic or testing procedures performed
  - Use past tense and action verbs
  - Extract dates from the work status table. If no date is available for a specific action, use "Date not specified" or the work order date
  - Extract time from the work status table or notes when available. If time is not provided, use "Time not specified"
  - Use the date format from the work status table (e.g.,  "MM-DD-YYYY") and the time format appearing in the data (e.g., "10:00 AM")

  ### RESULT: [What was the overall outcome? Was the issue resolved? Any recommendations or follow-up needed?]
  - State the current operational status
  - Indicate whether the issue was resolved, partially resolved, or requires further action
  - Include any recommendations for future maintenance or follow-up work
  - Note any remaining issues or limitations

  **SUCCESS**: Always set to true if the conversion was completed successfully

client_summary_conversion: |

  Please create:

  1. A short TWO-LINE SUMMARY that explains what the technician accomplished in clear business terms
     - Focus on the specific actions performed by the technician
     - Use professional business language that project managers understand
     - Keep it concise but informative about technician work

  2. DETAILED TECHNICAL NOTES focusing on technician actions performed
     - Detail ONLY the specific actions, steps, and procedures the technician actually described
     - Expand all technical abbreviations to their full forms (NCU → Network Control Unit, INV → Inverter, etc.)
     - Explain ONLY what the technician explicitly stated they did, how they did it, and what tools/equipment they mentioned
     - Include ONLY details about technician activities, processes, timing, and follow-up actions that were actually provided
     - Translate technical procedures into clear descriptions of technician work performed, but ONLY based on what was stated
     - Focus on technician actions rather than general work descriptions or outcomes
     - DO NOT add, infer, or create information not explicitly provided by the technician

  Example abbreviations:
    NCU → Network Control Unit
    INV → Inverter
    LBD → Line Break Device
    SPC → String Power Controller
    CMB → Combiner
    PAD → Panel
    POA -> Plane of Array
  Similarly convert all technical abbreviations to their full forms in the summary and notes.

  Requirements:
  - Focus specifically on what the technician did, not what happened to equipment
  - Detail ONLY the technician's actions, procedures, and work steps and abbreviations that were explicitly described
  - Make technician activities accessible to project managers and business stakeholders
  - Focus on technician accomplishments, how they performed the work, and what actions they took - ONLY as described
  - Explain technician actions and procedures in clear, detailed language, but ONLY what was stated
  - CRITICAL: Do not add, infer, assume, or create any information not explicitly provided by the technician

hold_reason_validation_instructions: |
    VALIDATION APPROACH - FOCUS ON CORE REQUIREMENTS:
    1. ANALYZE the hold reason content to identify hold type performed:
      - Look for evidence of "Parts unavailable" (waiting for parts, material shortage, supplier issues)
      - Look for evidence of "Warranty" (warranty claims, OEM contact, warranty evaluation)
      - Look for evidence of "Others" (weather, access issues, safety concerns, client delays)
      - DO NOT ask technicians to explicitly categorize their hold reason - analyze what they've already provided

    2. CORE VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS - THESE THREE ARE ESSENTIAL MAINLY:
      - **STRONG VALID REASON FOR HOLD** - Clear explanation of what caused the work to be put on hold
      - **ETA TO CONTINUE** - When they expect to resume work or when the issue will be resolved ("unknown" is acceptable if clearly stated)
      - **SPECIFY WHAT THEY'RE WAITING FOR** - Specific details about what needs to happen to resume work

    3. VALIDATION PHILOSOPHY - BE ANALYTICAL AND RECOGNIZE COMPLETENESS:
      - Analyze what hold reason was actually provided from the content
      - Look for evidence that fulfills the hold reason requirements in the provided notes
      - Recognize when technicians have already provided sufficient detail to meet requirements
      - Default to VALID if the hold reason described supports the claimed hold type AND includes the core requirements
      - If the log contains clear evidence of the hold types, mark as VALID even if not explicitly labeled

    4. ONLY mark as invalid if:
      - The hold reason content doesn't support the claimed hold type
      - The hold reason is missing one or more of the three core requirements
      - The hold reason is completely empty or unrelated to the work order

    5. For clarification, ask about missing details that would justify the hold type:
      - Ask for more specific details about what caused the hold
      - Ask about expected resolution timeline or next steps ONLY if not provided and not explicitly marked as "unknown"
      - DO NOT ask for explicit breakdowns by hold type
