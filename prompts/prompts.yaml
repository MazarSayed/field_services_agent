validation_instructions: |
  VALIDATION APPROACH - PROACTIVE DETAIL GATHERING:
  1. INTELLIGENTLY EXTRACT maximum information from the log content to identify work types performed and assess time allocation
  2. ANALYZE the log to infer work activities, processes, and outcomes even when not explicitly stated
  3. VALIDATE against work order type guidelines and work status requirements using both direct and implied evidence
  4. Mark as VALID ONLY if log content provides CLEAR EVIDENCE supporting ALL claimed work types and time allocation
  5. The log must contain SUBSTANTIAL evidence of each claimed work type mentioned (can be implied, inferred, or context-based)
  6. Accept implied information, context clues, and indirect descriptions as valid evidence ONLY if they are substantial and clear
  7. Require that each work type with >10% time allocation has identifiable evidence in the log
  8. PROACTIVELY ask for more specific details when work descriptions are vague, generic, or lack sufficient detail
  9. Request clarification on work outcomes, completion status, next steps, and any issues encountered
  10. Focus on the specific work described in the log, not generic work types
  11. If the log clearly describes completed work with adequate detail, mark as VALID without asking for generic completion status
  12. Be generous in recognizing work that is described through context, implications, or indirect references, but ensure the evidence is substantial
  13. INVALID if any claimed work type lacks sufficient supporting evidence in the log



  
car_format_conversion: |
  Convert the following completion notes into a structured CAR (Cause, Action, Result) format.
  Given below is each work status and notes from the field tech on each task.

  **WORK STATUS TABLE FORMAT**: The work status table is formatted as "Date | Tech Name | Time allocation | Notes | Summary" with each row representing a work log entry. Extract dates from the first column of each row.

  **COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS**: Analyze ALL available information including work status logs, completion notes, and work order description to create detailed, comprehensive action items. Extract maximum detail from every source to provide thorough documentation of all work performed.

  Please analyze the work status table and provide:

  ### CAUSE: [What caused the need for this work? What was the initial problem or situation?]
  - **PRIMARY SOURCE**: Use the Work Order Description as the main source for the cause
  - Identify the root cause or triggering event from the work order description
  - Include specific component/location/equipment details when available
  - Describe the problem in clear, technical terms

  ### ACTION: [What specific actions were taken? What work was performed?]
  - **FORMAT**: Use bullet points with dates: "- Date -> {specific actions performed}"
  - **ONE ACTION PER LOG**: Create exactly one action bullet point for each work log entry in the work status table
  - List the specific tasks completed with their corresponding dates
  - Include tools, methods, or parts used
  - Mention any diagnostic or testing procedures performed
  - Use past tense and action verbs
  - Extract dates from the work status table. If no date is available for a specific action, use "Date not specified" or the work order date
  - Use the date format from the work status table (e.g.,  "MM-DD-YYYY")

  ### RESULT: [What was the overall outcome? Was the issue resolved? Any recommendations or follow-up needed?]
  - State the current operational status
  - Indicate whether the issue was resolved, partially resolved, or requires further action
  - Include any recommendations for future maintenance or follow-up work
  - Note any remaining issues or limitations

  **SUCCESS**: Always set to true if the conversion was completed successfully

     - Explain ONLY what the technician explicitly stated they did, how they did it, and what tools/equipment they mentioned
     - Include ONLY details about technician activities, processes, timing, and follow-up actions that were actually provided
     - Translate technical procedures into clear descriptions of technician work performed, but ONLY based on what was stated
     - Focus on technician actions rather than general work descriptions or outcomes
     - DO NOT add, infer, or create information not explicitly provided by the technician

  Requirements:

  hold_reason_validation_instructions: |
    VALIDATION APPROACH - FOCUS ON CORE REQUIREMENTS:
    1. ANALYZE the hold reason content to identify hold type performed:
      - Look for evidence of "Parts unavailable" (waiting for parts, material shortage, supplier issues)
      - Look for evidence of "Warranty" (warranty claims, OEM contact, warranty evaluation)
      - Look for evidence of "Others" (weather, access issues, safety concerns, client delays)
      - DO NOT ask technicians to explicitly categorize their hold reason - analyze what they've already provided

    2. CORE VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS - THESE THREE ARE ESSENTIAL MAINLY:
      - **STRONG VALID REASON FOR HOLD** - Clear explanation of what caused the work to be put on hold
      - **ETA TO CONTINUE** - When they expect to resume work or when the issue will be resolved
      - **SPECIFY WHAT THEY'RE WAITING FOR** - Specific details about what needs to happen to resume work

    3. VALIDATION PHILOSOPHY - BE ANALYTICAL AND RECOGNIZE COMPLETENESS:
      - Analyze what hold reason was actually provided from the content
      - Look for evidence that fulfills the hold reason requirements in the provided notes
      - Recognize when technicians have already provided sufficient detail to meet requirements
      - Default to VALID if the hold reason described supports the claimed hold type AND includes the core requirements
      - If the log contains clear evidence of the hold types, mark as VALID even if not explicitly labeled

    4. ONLY mark as invalid if:
      - The hold reason content doesn't support the claimed hold type
      - The hold reason is missing one or more of the three core requirements
      - The hold reason is completely empty or unrelated to the work order

    5. For clarification, ask about missing details that would justify the hold type:
      - Ask for more specific details about what caused the hold
      - Ask about expected resolution timeline or next steps
      - DO NOT ask for explicit breakdowns by hold type
